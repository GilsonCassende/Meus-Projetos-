                Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely <br>   
                I have nobody for my own <br>
                I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely <br>
                I have nobody for my own <br>
                I am so lonely <br>
                Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man <br>
                Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord <br>
                That's always been there, man <br>
                Like, took all the bullshit <br>
                But then one day, she can't take it no more and decide to leave <br>
                Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night <br>
                And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side <br>
                Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her <br>
                I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride <br>
                Backtracking over these few years <br>
                Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad <br>
                'Cause ever since my girl left me <br>
                My whole life came crashing and I'm so <br>
                Lonely (so lonely) <br>
                I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely) <br>
                I have nobody (I have nobody) <br>
                For my own (to call my own girl) <br>
                I'm so lonely (so lonely) <br>

                And I just let you walk right outta my life <br>
                After all I put you through <br>
                You still stuck around and stayed by my side <br>
                What really hurt me is I broke your heart <br>
                Baby, you're a good girl and I had no right <br>
                I really wanna make things right <br>
                'Cause without you in my life girl, I'm so <br>

                Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl <br>
                That can take the things that you been through <br>
                Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run <br>
                And I would be out chasing you <br>
                'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be <br>
                Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see <br>
                Than the girl of my dreams that made me be <br>
                So happy but now so lonely <br>
